# usdBVHAnim

This plug-in enables USD to read BVH animation files.

Once installed, USD can either read them directly, e.g.:

`> usdview ./walk_motion.bvh`

Or compose BVH data into a larger scene through its composition arcs, e.g:

```
over "AnimationData"
(
    references = @./walk_motion.bvh@
)
{
}
```

In practise, here are some example use cases that are made possible by the plug-in:

* Use `usdview` to inspect and play back skeletal animation data in BVH files
* Use `usdrecord` to render playblasts of BVH motion capture data on the command line
* Use USD to transcode BVH motion capture data to other file formats
* Use USD to compose BVH animation into a larger scene composition
* Extend a DCC that supports USD (and the usdSkel schema) to import BVH animation data
* Write your skeletal animation pipeline on top of USD and use this plug-in to ingest BVH data into it
* Ingest the various open source motion capture data sets delivered in BVH (Ubisoft LAFAN1, etc...) into your USD-based skeletal animation pipeline


## Build Instructions

### Build Configurations

To build this plugin, the build configuration you choose must match that of your OpenUSD distro,
otherwise you will get compiler and linker errors.

So, to build this plugin for production environments, against a Release build of OpenUSD, please
use `--config Release` (all instructions below will follow this, as its the most common use case).

Likewise, to build this plugin against a Debug build of OpenUSD, please use `--config Debug`.

### Building Locally

* Ensure the toolchain requirements are installed (see below)
* On Linux open a bash shell, on Windows open the x64 Native Tools Command Prompt
* Make a build directory and cd into that (e.g. `mkdir build ; cd build`)
* Generate project files with: `cmake ../`
* Build the project with: `cmake --build ./ -- config Release`
* Build the documentation with: `cmake --build ./ --config Release --target docs`
* Run the tests with: `ctest -C Release ./`
* Validate source code formatting with: `cmake --build ./ --target format-check`
* Automatically format source code with: `cmake --build ./ --target format`

### Testing Locally

* Ensure the toolchain requirements are installed (see below)
* On Linux open a bash shell, on Windows open the x64 Native Tools Command Prompt
* Make a build directory and cd into that (e.g. `mkdir build ; cd build`)
* Specify your deployment directory when generating project files: `cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=./deploy ../`
* Install to a local deployment `cmake --build ./ --target install --config Release`
* Run the tests with: `ctest -C Release`
* Add your local deployment to `PXR_PLUGINPATH_NAME`, e.g:
  * `set PXR_PLUGINPATH_NAME=%cd%/deploy/bin` on Windows 
* Run `usdview` to open a .bvh file
